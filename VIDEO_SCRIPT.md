> **Upload to:** YouTube (unlisted) → paste public link into Devpost submission
> **Style:** Screen recording + motion graphics overlay, professional voiceover

## Cut Plan

### CUT 1 — THE HOOK (0:00–0:05)
**Visual:** Split screen. Left: user's monitor showing app switching (Slack → VS Code → Figma). Right: close-up of MX Creative Console with buttons morphing labels/icons in sync with each switch.

**Voiceover:** *"What if your devices knew what you needed — before you did?"*

**Music:** Subtle electronic ambient, builds slowly.

---

### CUT 2 — THE PROBLEM (0:05–0:15)
**Visual:** Quick montage of a knowledge worker's screen — 8 browser tabs, Slack notifications, VS Code, Figma, Jira. Text overlay: "23 min average refocus time per context switch" (source: UC Irvine).

**Voiceover:** *"Knowledge workers switch between 6 to 9 apps per task — losing over an hour a day to context switching. Your tools are powerful. But your controls? Static."*

**Text overlay at 0:12:** "6-9 app switches per task"

---

### CUT 3 — THE SOLUTION (0:15–0:40)
**Visual:** Clean desk shot with MX Creative Console + MX Master4. Screen recording shows three live transitions:

**Transition 1 (0:15–0:22):** User opens Slack → Console shows: Reply, React, Thread, Huddle, Search, Pin, Snooze, Status, DND. Dial scrolls channels.

**Transition 2 (0:22–0:30):** User switches to VS Code (auth.ts) → Console morphs to: Run Tests ★, Git Commit, Git Push, Toggle Terminal, Split Editor, Toggle Sidebar, Open PR, Format, Palette. Dial scrolls open tabs with haptic detents.

**Transition 3 (0:30–0:38):** Calendar popup: "Team standup in 2 min" → Console surfaces: Join Call, Mute, Camera Off, Share Screen, Set DND, Open Notes, Start Timer, End Call, Record. Actions Ring shows [Join Call] [Mute] [Notes].

**Voiceover:** *"FlowPilot turns your MX Creative Console and MX Master4 into an intelligent command surface. It detects what you're doing and reconfigures every button, dial, and Actions Ring shortcut — automatically. Switch to Slack? Communication controls. Jump to VS Code? Developer tools, with your most likely next action predicted and highlighted. Meeting starting? Collaboration controls surface before you even think to look for them."*

---

### CUT 4 — THE ARCHITECTURE (0:38–0:48)
**Visual:** Animated diagram (simple, clean): four boxes flowing left to right: Sensing → Reasoning → Surface Management → Devices. Key labels: "Win32 APIs", "Local AI (Phi-3)", "Actions SDK", "MX Console + Master4 + Ring".

**Voiceover:** *"Under the hood, FlowPilot uses local AI — no cloud, no data leaves your machine. A rule engine handles instant app detection, while a small language model learns your patterns to predict what you'll need next."*

**Text overlay:** "100% Local • <100ms Surface Switch • Privacy-First"

---

### CUT 5 — THE CLOSE (0:48–0:60)
**Visual:** MX Creative Console with FlowPilot logo on center button, glowing softly. Text builds:
- "FlowPilot"
- "Your Workflow, On Autopilot"
- "Category: MX Creative Console + MX Master4 & Actions Ring"
- "Built with Logitech Actions SDK"

**Voiceover:** *"FlowPilot. The first meta-plugin for Logitech devices. Your workflow, on autopilot."*

**Music:** Resolves to clean ending.

## Production Notes

| Element | Specification |
|---|---|
| Resolution | 1920×1080 (1080p) minimum |
| Duration | 55–60 seconds (hard cap at 60s) |
| Audio | Professional voiceover + subtle background music (royalty-free) |
| Captions | Burned-in subtitles for accessibility |
| Thumbnail | MX Creative Console with FlowPilot branding |
| Upload | YouTube (unlisted), ensure "public" visibility per rules |
| Branding | Consistent color scheme: Logitech teal (#00B8A9) + dark gray (#2D3436) |

## Screen Recording Requirements

- [ ] MX Creative Console close-up camera angle (or high-quality mockup)
- [ ] Screen recordings of Slack, VS Code, Figma with realistic content
- [ ] Calendar notification popup (can be staged)
- [ ] Actions Ring overlay appearance
- [ ] Architecture diagram animation (After Effects / Keynote / Figma)

## Alternative: Mockup-Only Approach (if no physical device)

Since Phase 1 is concept-only, a **high-quality animated mockup** showing the device surface changing is fully acceptable. Tools:
- Figma prototype with device frame
- After Effects animation of button label transitions
- Keynote/PowerPoint animation exported as video
